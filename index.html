<h1>Frieda's Favourite Films <3</h1>
<h2>My top 3 films of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite Studio Ghibli films, made my Hayao Miyazaki in the 2000's. 
    It is about a woman who has a spell put on her by The Witch of the Waste, turning her into an old lady.
    She ends up going on an adventure to try and find a cure for her curse: meeting the handsome wizard Howl,
    and his companions.</p>

<h3>A Single Man</h3>
<p>A movie written, directed and produced by well-known fashion designer Tom Ford. The story writing is beautifully
    tragic and the characterisation of the main protagonist, played by Colin Firth, takes my breath away.
    The story follows the aftermath of his lover's death in a car accident, and how it affects him and his life in
    the aftermath of the disaster. His melancholic personality is one I can relate to immensly, and as a result,
    I feel a huge amount of love for this character. Lastly, the visuals and stunning with clever use of colour and mood.</p>

<h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>
<p>A sequel/remake of the original Blade Runner; produced in 1982. This version takes sleekness and cyber aesthetics to the
    next level! I love the original, but this version inspires me more. Ryan Gosling plays blade runner 'K' who 'retires' 
    Nexus 6/8 replicants, similarly to Decker. We see the world as it was designed in the original film, with a score by the
    same composer Vangelis. It is a must-watch for sci-fi fans!</p>
